### About 
They say a minesweeper makes only two mistakes in their life: the first is their choice of occupation, and the second one is fatal. In this project, you will create your own, safe "Minesweeper" – a game that will be a brain teaser for both you and your players.

### Learning outcomes
This project will teach you how to work with lists in Kotlin. You will be dealing with algorithms for generating the minefield and processing the player moves.

### What you’ll do and what you’ll learn
|Stage|Description|
|-------|----------|
|Stage 1/5|Lay the groundwork: Minesweeper is a game of logic where the player is presented with a field full of hidden mines. The goal is to mark the positions of all mines without setting any of them off. It's not a game of wild guessing: it offers hints showing the number of mines around each cell. One wrong move, and game over!|
|Stage 2/5|Flexible mines: It's no fun when the field has the same setup every time and you know where all the mines are located. Let's generate a random configuration every time the player wants to play the game.To improve the program, we need to let the player choose how many mines they want on the field. The player needs to input the number of mines they want with their keyboard.|
|Stage 3/5|Look around you: The player needs hints to be able to win, and we want them to have a chance to win! Let's show the number of mines around the empty cells so that our players have something to work with.|
|Stage 4/5|Prepare for battle: We managed to create the minefield and fill it with clues: now it's time to play! Let's give our player the opportunity to guess where the mines are with the help of our hints. All the numbers are still shown to the player, but now the mines are not. To win, the player must find all the mines on the field by marking them. Update the field input and add the coordinate grid like in the examples so that the player can mark cells by entering their coordinates.|
|Stage 5/5|Battle! In this stage, you will upgrade your program to act just like the original Minesweeper game! We won't show all the hints from the beginning anymore, but we will allow the player to explore the minefield by themselves, which is much more challenging and fun. The game starts with an unexplored minefield that has a user-defined number of mines.|
